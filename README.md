# NodejsPractice
Practice with nodejs express and typescript

# Getting started
Download to your machine with git.

# Installation
cd into project directory.
mkdir ProjectName
cd ProjectName

For installation first get everything you need for a nodejs express server
1. npm
2. nvm - with a curl command (https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
3. node (using `nvm install <version of node needed>`)

Typings (https://www.npmjs.com/package/typings)
1. typings to install the typing objects such as jquery, express, node (for typscript to understand) and many more (https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)

2. ntypescript (tsc) - typscript compiler to javascript .ts -> .js (https://github.com/TypeStrong/ntypescript)

3. `git clone repo`
run npm install, might need the sudo.
run `typings install`
# Running project
run `ntypescript`
run `node app.js`



Side Note: Any packages you include with npm you, most of the time, will find a typescript version as well.
